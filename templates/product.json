            "icon": "none",
            "content": "<h2>Why Ours Is Priced Higher</h2><p>If you’ve come across cheaper “pure titanium” pans online — or even bought one — that’s understandable. Most of them aren’t truly titanium at all. They’re typically industrial steel alloys with a trace amount of titanium added, just enough to justify the label. That lowers production costs, but removes the very benefits people are looking for, while introducing new downsides.</p><p><strong>Walter</strong> is different. It’s crafted from <strong>certified 99.86% pure Grade 1 titanium</strong> — a material that’s exceptionally difficult and expensive to work with. That challenge is exactly why it performs the way it does, and why we’re able to support it with verified proof.</p><h2>How SlipScale™ Works</h2><p>SlipScale™ is a first-of-its-kind surface technology that redefines non-stick performance — without coatings. Instead of relying on chemicals, the surface is precisely imprinted with a micro-scale pattern that improves food release by up to <strong>3×</strong>.</p><p>These micro-ridges reduce direct contact between food and the pan while helping oils spread evenly. The result is a natural release layer that allows food to glide smoothly instead of sticking.</p><h2>How It Helps Preserve Nutrients</h2><p>Pure titanium conducts heat efficiently and evenly, allowing you to cook at lower temperatures without sacrificing performance. Research shows that lower-temperature cooking can help retain <strong>up to 30% more nutrients</strong>, particularly heat-sensitive vitamins like vitamin C, compared to conventional cookware.</p><h2>What Biocompatibility Means</h2><p>Titanium is considered the most biocompatible metal available — meaning the human body does not react negatively to it. This is why it’s widely used in surgical implants. It remains stable, non-reactive, and safe for repeated, direct contact with food.</p><h2>Why Acidic Foods Damage Other Pans</h2><p>Ingredients like lemon, tomato, and pepper release acids that can react with steel or synthetic non-stick coatings. Over time, this can degrade the surface and allow metals or chemicals to leach into food.</p><p>Titanium is the most corrosion-resistant metal known. It remains completely stable, regardless of acidity, ensuring consistent performance with any recipe.</p><h2>Is It Truly Pure?</h2><p>Yes. Each pan is tested by <strong>SGS</strong>, the world’s leading independent testing laboratory. Verification confirms a purity level of <strong>99.86% Grade 1 titanium</strong> — the highest practical purity available for cookware.</p><h2>What FDA-Compliant Means</h2><p>FDA compliance confirms the pan meets strict food-contact safety standards. That means:</p><ul><li>No harmful coatings<br/></li><li>No unsafe metals<br/></li><li>No chemical exposure<br/></li><li>Lead-free construction<br/></li></ul><p>Nothing unnecessary near your food — just clean, stable materials.</p>",
