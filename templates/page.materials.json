Research shows that more than 95% of people already have these substances in their blood, often due to exposure to non-stick coatings, plastics, and packaging.</p><p>That's why <strong>titanium</strong> is at the core of everything we make. It is naturally safe, durable, and completely free of PFAS, PFOA, BPA, and other harmful coatings that wear off over time. Only pure, stable materials touch your food — today and in the future.</p><h4>Free from harmful substances</h4><p>Many cookware products still rely on synthetic coatings and plastic components that release microparticles when heated or worn. At Walter, we avoid this completely. Our products contain no toxic chemicals, no coatings that peel off, and no hidden risks. What remains is peace of mind in the kitchen — and confidence in what you eat.</p><h4>Built for everyday life</h4><p>Titanium is incredibly durable, does not rust, and remains stable at high temperatures. No peeling coating, no loss of performance, no compromises. This is cookware you can use every day, year after year, without ever compromising on quality.</p>"
